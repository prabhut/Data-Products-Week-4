### Storm Database Explorer

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Dataset has been obtained from [the Coursera Reproducible Research Course site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and processed as a part of peer assignment for this course.

The purpose of this application is to display the understanding of using shiny to build a simple application called Storm Data Explorer. 

This has been developed and deployed at: https://tsprabhu.shinyapps.io/dpw4_shinyapp/

The application allows the user to:

Select the inputs such as the range of years, types of weather related events.

Select the format of the output to be displayed on the map, or as a graph, or as a table and option to download the filtered data.
